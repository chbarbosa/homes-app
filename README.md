# Angular Practice Project
This is an Angular-based web application developed as part of my learning journey with Angular. Starting from the foundational concepts covered in the Angular.dev course, I expanded the project by implementing additional components, services, and features to reinforce my understanding.

## Features
- Component-Based Architecture: Structured with reusable and modular components.

- Routing & Navigation: Implemented dynamic routing for seamless page transitions.

- State Management: Used services or signals (or NgRx, if applicable) for state handling.

- API Integration: Connected to a RESTful API for data fetching/manipulation.

- And some animations
